                            One cannot find the solution if you are not aware of the problem.
                            That's what She does, finding problems as well as the right way to 
                            deal with it and get the successive outcomes. A good start comes with
                            perfect planning, analyzing the requiremints and finalizing it.

                            "I talk less and work more", she says! Today's Web Developer  not only
                            takes charge of the Front-end but makes sure of the right flow from front-end
                            to back-end. A Designer makes sure their work is edgy and attracts the audience! 
                            She makes sure that the design is faultless and connects to its users.

                            He follows what Aristotle said-
                            “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.” 
                            Being from ECE background doesn't stops him from achieving the tasks and nailing it! 
                            Not only he is new to Development, he is a quick on trigger. His contribution in 
                            design and debugging the codes and finalizing the alignment of modules  is surprisengly amazing.

                            Body without Brain is useless in the same way a web design is just
                            a structure without logics. Her Logical ability is refreshing makes 
                            everything complete. The Logical head knows how to handle Database 
                            functionality and gives the right current to the data.
